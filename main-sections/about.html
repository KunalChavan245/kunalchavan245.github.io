      <p>
        I'm <strong>Kunal Chavan</strong>, a passionate AI and computer vision researcher pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at VIT. I love building real-world systems powered by deep learning, from IoT-based anomaly detection to edge-deployed object recognition.
      </p>

      <p>
        My research journey includes internships at <strong>NUS (Remote)</strong> and <strong>IIT Dharwad</strong>, where I explored state-of-the-art techniques in Vision-Language Models, anomaly detection, and multi-modal systems. I’m also deeply interested in deploying LLMs on edge devices and optimizing models for performance and latency.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in using AI to solve practical problems, and I enjoy working across the full stack — data collection, model training, evaluation, and deployment. I'm AWS certified and have hands-on experience with Jetson devices, Hugging Face, and OpenCV.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart from tech, I enjoy mentoring, participating in hackathons, and contributing to open-source. I'm always open to collaboration and love engaging with the community.
